Trinidad sandbox extension
======

# DESCRIPTION

Trinidad's management console and REST api.

This extension adds a management console to a Trinidad's instance moreover a rest api to access the applications running on top of it.


# INSTALL

jruby -S gem install trinidad_sandbox_extension

# CONFIGURATION

The extension has to be added within the section "extensions" into the Trinidad's configuration file:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:

This extension is also a Sinatra web application running on top of Trinidad, so any application configuration parameter is also valid here.
For instance, we can modify the context path where is running the console:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      context_path: management # by default the context path is sandbox

It also supports basic authentication, we'll have to specify the username and password within our section:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      username: manager
      password: XXXXXXX

We can also use the console in readonly mode, so users can see the applications deployed but they cannot deploy new ones or modify them:

--- 
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      readonly: true

# FEATURES

The console as well as the REST api allow to list all the applications managed by that Trinidad's instance and start/stop them.
By security reasons the sandbox application is not listed nor can be stopped.

# GIT DEPLOYMENT

The sandbox console also allows to deploy new applications into Trinidad via Git. By default it uses ssh keys to access to the repository with the user `git`.

We can also use git hooks to deploy applications via a POST-Receive callback. 
In this case we use a token for authentication that must be set in the configuration, then we'll use an url like we show bellow in our hook:

---
  extensions:
    sandbox:
      deploy_token: ULTRA_SECRET_TOKEN

POST-Receive url: http://host/sandbox/deploy?deploy_token=ULTRA_SECRET_TOKEN
